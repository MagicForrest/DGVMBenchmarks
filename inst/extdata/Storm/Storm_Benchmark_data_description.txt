Storm Disturbance Benchmark Description:

Simulated wind damage in a severe storm averaged over the period 1986-2020 and how this combines with annual storm probability
to produce an estimate of annual wind damage.
The results across the simulation domain are benchmarked to observation-based damage statistics from the DFDE database
Storm disturbance compared to expert gapfilled total damage by wind (m3 per ha forest) by country 1986-2019 from the DFDE database
as analazed by Patacca et al. (2022)
Wind damage per country in 2020 directly taken from the DFDE database (milj m3)

Description of Regrowth data:

The observational dataset of temperate regrowth curves  of aboveground woody carbon are derived from chronosequence data in Teobaldelli et al 2009,
omitting foliage and root biomass pools. For boreal biome-level data, we used biomass chronosequence data calculated for Repo et al., (2021)
based on Finnish national forest inventory plots (Tomppo et al., 2011). We also selected a subset of NFI plots,
which were either conserved or had low-intensity management (last management > 30 years ago) across southern and central Finland.
To arrive at aboveground woody carbon, we removed the foliage biomass fraction based on stand-age-based biomass expansion factors (BEFs)
using age-dependent foliage-total biomass relationships calculated from Lehntonen et al 2004.
Boreal forest data for forest regrowth was prepared by collaborators from the ForestPaths project (Mikko Peltoniemi).
Regrowth data is organised in 20 year age bins and we report the median, lower 10th percentile and upper 90th percentile boundary.
At least 20 observations are in each bin, following Pugh et al. 2019
Boreal regrowth data originates from the National Forests Inventory of Finland (Korhonen et al. 2021)
and permanent sample plots from NFI9 (1996-2003),
NFI10 (2004-2008), NFI11 (2009-2013) and NFI12 (2014-2018) have been used.
The data has been derived similarly as in the Repo et al (2021) paper,
but that this one has only unmanaged stands, while Repo et al. (2021) has analyzed managed stands.
